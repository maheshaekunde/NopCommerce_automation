### Usage

Follow these steps to effectively utilize our automation testing framework or scripts:

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you start running the tests, ensure you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section of this README.

### 2. Configuration

Customize the test configuration to match your specific testing environment. This typically involves modifying configuration files or environment variables. Here's an example for configuring test parameters:

```bash
# Example configuration for Selenium-based tests
export BASE_URL="https://example.com"
export BROWSER="chrome"
export HEADLESS_MODE="true"
```

### 3. Running Tests

Use the following command to execute the test suite. Replace `<test_suite>` with the name of your test suite or specific test files you want to run:

```bash
robot <test_suite>.robot
```

For example, to run the regression test suite, you would use:

```bash
robot regression_tests.robot
```

### 4. Viewing Reports

After running tests, you can find detailed test reports generated in the `output` directory. Open the HTML report in a web browser to review test results and any issues detected during testing.

### 5. Extending and Writing Tests

Feel free to extend and customize our test automation scripts according to your specific testing needs. If you'd like to write new tests, follow these steps:

- Create a new `.robot` file in the appropriate directory.
- Write test cases using the Robot Framework syntax.
- Add the new test file to the test suite or specify it when running tests.

### 6. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

Consider integrating this automation testing framework into your CI/CD pipeline to automate tests on code changes or deployments. You can use popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.

### 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the automation testing framework, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section in this README for solutions to common problems.
